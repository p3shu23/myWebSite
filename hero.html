<p> Marie Sklodowska Curie was a Polish/French chemist who is notable for her findings of Radium and Polonium. Her conclusions were influential with the chemistry community of the world that she received 2 Nobel prizes in the category of Chemistry, one in 1903 and 1911. Curie was the first woman awarded a prize and the first person to win this prestigious award twice. Marie Curie was born on November 7, 1867, in Warsaw, Poland. She was mainly brought up by her father, who was a math and physics professor, and as a young child, she was bright and curious. Since Curie was a woman, she was not able to attend the public university and took informal classes that were taught underground. Later, she travelled to Paris and enrolled at the Sorbonne where she received her master's degree in Physics and Mathematics. Marie Curie later married Pierre Curie on July 26, 1895, and became the dynamic scientific duo who worked on many projects together. Both worked together to discover the new element Radium. After Pierre Curie died, she took his place as a professor and became the first female professor at the institution.

<p> My hero is Marie Curie. Not only was she an influential scientist, but she inspired many girls and women in STEM to reshape the gender roles of the sciences and maths. As a girl who is interested in science, especially chemistry, Curie was always someone who I looked up as a role figure and guidance. She inspired me to become a young scientist in learning and doing the science fair to enhance knowledge for myself and the community. I look up to her to push myself during the times when I am doing my science fair projects and when I am confused or have to do presentations to scientists about the findings I have made. She paved the road for many to explore the unknown and created the foundation of doing the process of scientific investigation. She is my hero, and I aspire to be like this powerful woman and recreate society's footsteps of perceiving women in STEM in the future.
